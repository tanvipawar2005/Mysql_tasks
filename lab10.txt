ChatGPT prompt:

"Write an SQL query using FULL OUTER JOIN to generate a report that includes all products from the 'inventory' table and their corresponding sales from the 'sales' table. The 'inventory' table has columns: ProductID, ProductName, StockQuantity. The 'sales' table has columns: SaleID, ProductID (foreign key), SaleQuantity, SaleDate. The output should show all products, whether sold or not, with NULLs for unsold products."
