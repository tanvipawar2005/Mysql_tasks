ChatGPT Prompt :
Prompt: I have two tables in my database: Employee with columns (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, ManagerID) and Manager with columns (ManagerID, ManagerName). I want to write an SQL query that retrieves each employee along with their manager's name. The result should include employees even if they don't have a manager. Use a LEFT JOIN. Please generate the SQL query for this.
